Javascript SDK based on React, OpenLayers and Redux.

For the previous version, please see the 1.x branch instead.

## Running Project
To run the examples, 

Clone Project

In directory of cloned project

`npm install` - install libraries
`npm run build:examples` - build examples from templates
`npm start` - start webpack

http://localhost:3000/build/examples - browse to examples

## Troubleshooting

If `npm install` fails to install `canvas`, your system may require some package installations. See the `node-canvas` repo for instructions based on OS: https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas

If `npm start` fails review node version, SDK targets v6.0 or greater.  On OSX node install can be error prone, seems to work best when installed by Brew http://brewformulas.org/Node

## Running tests

The test suite will skip a number of tests unless the `canvas` module has been installed.

For more details on installing `canvas` and other important developer notes
please read [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md).
