# 2.7.1

The v2.7.1 release replaces redux-thunk with redux-saga, and fixes a few bugs:

## Bug fixes

 * Moves the React DND context creation to the calling application.


### Upgrade notes

To emulate the old catalog behaviour you will need to wrap it in a context.

```

import {DragDropContext} from 'react-dnd';
import HTML5Backend from 'react-dnd-html5-backend';

...

  // Add DND to the LayerList
  const DragDropLayerList = DragDropContext(HTML5Backend)(SdkLayerList);
...


```
