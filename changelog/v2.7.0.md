# 2.7.0

## Features

The data passed to `setView` on the map component has changed. 
Previously, the OpenLayers Map class was passed to `setView`, this has
been updated to pass an object with the following members:

 * `center` - Array of Latitude and Longitude in EPSG:4326.
 * `zoom` - The zoom level.
 * `bearing` - The rotation of the map.
 * `extent` - The current viewable extent of the map.
 * `resolution` - The resolution which corresponds to the zoom level.

## Bug fixes

No bug fixes since 2.6.5.

### Upgrade notes

If you were using the `setView` prop of the `Map` component you will
need to change to use the new view object instead of the previous
OpenLayers Map class.

Example:

```javascript
setView={(map) => {
  console.log(map.getView().getResolution());
}}
```

Should now be:

```javascript
setView={(view) => {
  console.log(view.resolution);
}}
```
