# 2.3.1

The v2.3.1 release contains a few bug fixes since the v2.3.0 release.

## Bug fixes

 * Check for the existance of sources before trying to access setData (#817)
 * Moving side effects to componentWillReceiveProps (#818)
 * Fix several issues with the drawing tools (#819)

### Upgrade notes

#### onFeatureDrawn, onFeatureModified
To sync with the behaviour of the Map component, the MapboxGL component has also been adapted so that the onFeatureDrawn and onFeatureModified callbacks now get a collection of features instead of a single feature.
